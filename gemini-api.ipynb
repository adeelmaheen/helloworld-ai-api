Here are a few examples, demonstrating different approaches and use cases:\n","\n","**1. Using the `list.sort()` method (in-place sorting):**\n","\n","This method modifies the original list directly.  It's efficient for large lists because it doesn't create a copy.\n","\n","```python\n","my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\n","my_list.sort()  # Sorts in ascending order by default\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]\n","\n","my_list.sort(reverse=True)  # Sorts in descending order\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n","```\n","\n","**2. Using the `sorted()` function (creates a new sorted list):**\n","\n","This function returns a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged.  This is useful when you need to preserve the original list.\n","\n","```python\n","my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\n","sorted_list = sorted(my_list)\n","print(my_list)       # Output: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6] (original list unchanged)\n","print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] (new sorted list)\n","\n","sorted_list_desc = sorted(my_list, reverse=True)\n","print(sorted_list_desc) # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n","```\n","\n","**3. Sorting with a custom key function:**\n","\n","This allows you to sort based on a specific attribute or criteria of the list elements.  For example, if your list contains tuples, you can sort by the second element of each tuple:\n","\n","\n","```python\n","my_list = [(1, 'z'), (2, 'a'), (3, 'b')]\n","sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda item: item[1]) # Sort by the second element (string)\n","print(sorted_list)  # Output: [(2, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (1, 'z')]\n","\n","\n","#Example with Objects\n","class Person:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","\n","people = [Person(\"Alice\", 30), Person(\"Bob\", 25), Person(\"Charlie\", 35)]\n","sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda person: person.age)\n","print([p.name for p in sorted_people]) # Output: ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie']\n","\n","```\n","\n","Remember to choose the method that best suits your needs. If you need to modify the list in place, use `list.sort()`. If you need to keep the original list intact, use `sorted()`.  The `key` argument provides powerful customization for sorting based on complex criteria.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!curl -o butterfly.jpg \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/29907755/pexels-photo-29907755/free-photo-of-butterfly-resting-on-wildflowers-in-nature.jpeg\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lx9Xd4uUdv0s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736080764959,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Maheen Arif","userId":"15058075601954418433"}},"outputId":"5761000a-f65f-437e-c656-c7768636383d"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","\r  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0\r100 1864k  100 1864k    0     0  15.8M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 15.9M\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import PIL.Image\n","img = PIL.Image.open('butterfly.jpg')\n","img\n",""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000,"output_embedded_package_id":"16QZpueY4hgu80s287OMXBXA89-kbtN25"},"id":"XDduT2FTeF9P","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736080811300,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":44161,"user":{"displayName":"Maheen Arif","userId":"15058075601954418433"}},"outputId":"15ffd52d-c23a-4d25-f695-7548915e6dfa"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = \"\"\"This image contains a sketch of a potential product along with some notes.\n","Given the product sketch, describe the product as thoroughly as possible based on what you\n","see in the image, making sure to note all of the product features.
